Down in the depths of my soul
Feeling the loss of control
In its spirit
So colourful
If you feel it then let's go
To a place where you belong
Give it strength to carry on
Open your heart
Set your mind at ease
Live your life
And you'll be free
We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise
Uhm, uhhm
Rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise
Yeah, hey yeah, uhmm
Sometimes you feel like
You're down and out
Feeling the pressure
And you're in doubt
And you're feeling low
Nowhere to go
Don't you worry
I know you're gonna
Rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise
Yeah, hey yeah, uhmm
We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
We're gonna rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising
Rise, rise, rise
Keep on rising, rising, rising
Rising, rising, rising
Rise
Ohh ohh yeah
